// These will be relatively hard to refactor.
// #import memory // * this uses generics.
// #import json   // * some bugs with self/self* type prevents this from compiling
// #import raylib // * big rewrite, almost everything. This is our biggest library, so that sucks.
// #import gl     // * big rewrite, not nearly as bad as raylib.
