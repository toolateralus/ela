Struct :: struct {
  f: float;

//! I have no fricken idea what is going on here.
//! Somehow defining a struct after including raylib causes Env struct to be emitted as {struct s64}???
//! When i step through it, i get Env's type id as something like 21750, which cannot be true.

//! I am throwing an error in the typer when the struct's resolved type is a scalar.
