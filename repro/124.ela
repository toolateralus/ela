// This typo crashes the compiler.
// We forgot the ::. We always terminate imports with ; so if we see a non-; and non
// :: symbol right after the first identifier, we should error.

// Really, any syntax errors in import statements just crash.
// This also causes an out of bounds vector access, just as above,
// must be an empty path. again-- same solution
