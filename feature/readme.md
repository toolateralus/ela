### This directory contains features that we want to implement.

- At the time of writing this, it basically expresses most of the features that will ever be added, some are rather ambitious and may never be implemented. 

- unless something comes up where it makes sense to go further with a feature, this is a good list of what to expect in the next few months/year.

- Also, when we move to a C backend (from c++), it's very likely some features just get totally pruned out from the existing
feature set. Especially ones that bring us too close to C++ in a negative way, things that don't matter but we did because it was easy since we transpile to c++. We want to be very C like, with modern features.
