/* 
  We have a couple ways to represent strings to interop well with c: 
  string literals with `"Hi!"` syntax will compile to a (const char *)
  for interop purposes. You may also use char *, but it will cause problems when
  writing foreign function declarations, it's best to use u8* for C style strings.
*/

/* 
  `string` owns it's own memory and memcpy's input. It does not need to be explicitly freed,
  and stores length information.

// * to access the u8* behind the managed string
str1_data := str1.data;

// * to access the length of the string (which is also null terminated)
str1_length := str1.length;

/* 
  * .length and .data are read-write safe, 
  * so to avoid a memcpy and strlen, you may set them yourself on a default constructed string.
  * for performance reasons, i.e a big string you just malloc'd or something.

/* Interpolated strings */

/* 
  * The string interpolation syntax is denoted by a string literal prefixed with `$`
  * The interpolated will be returned as a 'string' type.
  * to insert values, you use {my_value_expression} syntax within the string literal.
  * Any expression may be evaluated in the {}, including arithmetic, etc, unlike rust.
  * Any struct may be implicitly stringified if it implements a to_string() function that returns either a string or a u8*
*/

/* 
* The easiest way to concatenate two strings is also to use string interpolation.
