(CONTROL FLOW):
	Add control flow stuff to 
	While
	For
	etc.
	

-- TODO:
better typing in expressions  (||, != return bool) etc.
  explicit type conversions, implicit type conversions, 
 			added function types and better type info.
 			no conversion table yet: that can be done later easily.
 
Next phase
 
 : [0] ffi with C. #extern or #foreign or something for declarations;
 
 // less important
 : [1] First class types. make(int*) etc.
 : [1] Function pointers, first class functions.
 
Next phase
 : [0] Struct Declarations
 : [1] Method Declarations
 : [2] Postfix Expressions.  // dont use -> to dereference struct pointers. use '.' for everything.

 

Next phase
 : [2] Compile time reflection
 : [0] Operator Overloads. (do we even want this? could be helpful)
 : [1] Constructor/Destructor.
 
 object :: struct {
 	#constructor :: (object *self) {
		
 	}
 	#destructor :: (object *self) {
		
 	}
 }

 Unforseen future.
 : [1] in-language build system. library with build related functions
 : [2] in-language testing system. 'ela test' type ish. #test attributes
 : [3] compile time programs. use consteval and constexpr to try to get as far as possible without bytecode runtime.
