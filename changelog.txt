Changelog:

(1/20/2025 && 1/21/2025) :: {
  .. Removed built-in array[] and string types. 
     They still exist, but they're no longer hard-coded into the compiler,
     they're just in the standard library that's "ghost included" above every translation unit.

  .. Making more built-in interfaces 

  .. Refactor `for i in ...` range based loops. 
     This improves custom iterators, and also allows us to not depend on C++ for iterators.
     Now, we use Iterable![T] and Enumerable![T] interfaces.
  
  .. Rewrite `Range` type in Ela. Allows us to more easily customize how it works, 
     without the compiler requiring it as a hard-dependency
     The same reason as `string` and `T[]` being rewritten.

  .. Improve generic instantiation, more temporally accurate to where it won't have mixups in dependencies (done by Cooper Pilot)
