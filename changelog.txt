-------- (toolateralus): 6/13/2025, 11:27 AM: ----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Added `[T]` slice type syntax. mutable slices are `mut [T]`

- Added `[T; N]` array syntax. clears up a lot of ambiguity that had 
    existed between pointers, fn ptrs, and array types.

- Deprecated the `*` from the old `fn * ()` syntax. any time you refer to a function as an annotated type, 
    such as a field, parameter, etc, it's automatically a function pointer.

- Added the `![idx]` pointer arithmetic operator. clears up a ton of surface for subtle, hard to detect bugs when indexing self, and accidentaly a self *. or many of 
    the other areas where you can have index overloads, and also pointer arithmetic on many implicitly declared things.
    also, it's just much more clear for an operation that can be so unsafe.

- Added the ability for enumerators to reference other enumerators in an enum declaration. 
    useful for making an 'All' flag, or what have  you.

-------- (toolateralus) 7/2/2025, 9:54:19 AM ---------------------------------------------------------------------
- Added default methods to `#flags` enums which are in non-freestanding modules which use the standard library.
  - `set(..) // unset(..) // replace(..) // check(..)`

- Added a rough outline of structural typing. Lots of work needs to be done for the implicit conversions to work, if you want you can
  use the experimental/broken 'thir-temp' branch, where it does work. we're waiting on that to be completed, and merge back into main, for this
  to be a stable, usable feature.

  however, structurally ascribed types do work fine. so if i declare a variable `mut x: struct { x: f32, y: f32 }`
  this is treated as a normal, nominal type, and it is re-used when used in various places.

- At some point we changed `#self` to Self. it's just cleaner, and more sensible. it is a keyword, unlike `self`.

- I fell behind on this changelog. I am sure I am forgetting stuff; I haven't been working all that much on the compiler,
  but there have been some significant changes.

-------- (toolateralus) 7/7/2025, 10:46:02 AM ----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Added back explicit casting any pointer type to any other pointer type. this is needed for many low level memory reinterpretations,
  and casting to *void or *u8 just to cast back out is insanely clunky and makes worse code, not safer.
