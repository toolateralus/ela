- Added `[T]` slice type syntax. mutable slices are `mut [T]`

- Added `[T; N]` array syntax. clears up a lot of ambiguity that had 
    existed between pointers, fn ptrs, and array types.

- Deprecated the `*` from the old `fn * ()` syntax. any time you refer to a function as an annotated type, 
    such as a field, parameter, etc, it's automatically a function pointer.

- Added the `![idx]` pointer arithmetic operator. clears up a ton of surface for subtle, hard to detect bugs when indexing self, and accidentaly a self *. or many of 
    the other areas where you can have index overloads, and also pointer arithmetic on many implicitly declared things.
    also, it's just much more clear for an operation that can be so unsafe.

- Added the ability for enumerators to reference other enumerators in an enum declaration. 
    useful for making an 'All' flag, or what have  you.
