## Control Flow
- Add control flow stuff to 
  - While
  - For
  - etc.

## Typing:
- **explicit type conversions, implicit type conversions** 
- **no conversion table**, do we want one? or how do types define their ability to convert to others?

## Function stuff
- **need extern flags, other function modifiers** 
- **ffi with C. #extern or #foreign or something for declarations**
 
## Next phase
- **Struct Declarations** 
- **Method Declarations** 
- **Postfix Expressions** 
  - // don't use `->` to dereference struct pointers. use `.` for everything. 

## This seems out of scope:
- **First class types. make(int*) etc.** 
- **Function pointers, first class functions.** 

## Next phase
- [2] Compile time reflection
- [0] Operator Overloads. (do we even want this? could be helpful)
- [1] Constructor/Destructor.
