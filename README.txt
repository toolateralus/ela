The Ela language is very immature (2 months of daily development), but has a few key features:


- C-like memory simplicity.
- Strong typing, with structs, enums, unions, tagged unions, and interface types.
- Generic structs, interfaces, impl's, and functions/methods.
- Methods implemented for any type.
- A built-in dynamic array type, and a dynamic string built-in as well.
- Many other features!

  Right now, the compiler is in it's third reiteration, where we've transformed a lot of features, and added a lot of features.
  We are still hashing out a really solid foundation, so users are likely to encounter bugs.
  Please, still give the compiler a try! it's got a very ergonomic and easy to type syntax, and a lot of functionality reminsicent of C, Rust, Odin/Jai, and other influences.

  Note: The documentation that exists, is likely all wrong, and there is little of it.
  To get an idea of how most features work, you can check out the compiler's testing directory,
  Where many features have a test document which display how they can be used, but usually not in depth.
  
  Feel free to leave a github issue, or send an email to ela-language@gmail.com with any questions or remarks about the language.
  also, contributors of any capacity are welcome, and that includes additions to the standard library, such as a http library, tcp, ui frameworks, etc.
  
  Any level of contribution or suggestion is appreciated!
